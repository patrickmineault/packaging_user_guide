# What is this lecture about?

* Most people who end up doing research that's heavy on programming are not formally trained on CS or software engineering
* You're probably in this bucket
* Bad consequences:
    * You don't know what you're doing
    * Imposter syndrome
    * Low productivity
    * Bugs
    * You hate your code and you don't want to work on it
    * You graduate late
    * You have great sadness in your heart
* It doesn't have to be all bad!

# My weird perspective

* Patrick Mineault, PhD
* As undergrad, did programming on the side and ran an open source project called amfphp
* PhD on receptive fields in early visual cortex at the MNI with Chris Pack
* Postdoc at UCLA with Dario Ringach
* (wildly underqualified) software engineer at Google
* Research scientist at Facebook on brain-computer interfaces
* CTO of NMA, where we delivered a 3-week summer course in comp neuro to 1700 students
* Occasionally taught CS
* Independent researcher and technologist

# Regrets, I've had a few

* Wasted months working with bad code of my own making
* Didn't study CS until very late
* Wasn't until I joined Google that I became gooder at code
* I stand on the shoulders of giants who showed me the error of my ways
* Not a great coder, but definitely better than I was in grad school
* I think you might be curious

# Why is writing research code hard
