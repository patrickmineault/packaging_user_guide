# Lesson 2

Keep things decoupled

# Spaghetti code

![e.g [^1]](../figures/spaghetti-code.png)

[^1] Brown et al. AntiPatterns, 1998

# Do you know when your code smells?

- Maybe your code is written in a way where you're doing a little bit of everything all at once
- e.g. `wave_clus`
    - very useful software to sort spikes
    - has a GUI in Matlab GUIDE
    - GUIDE makes it exceptionally hard to write good code
    - Picked it because it's real code

# Sample code

[Link](https://github.com/csn-le/wave_clus/blob/master/wave_clus.m#L964).

# What's going here?

This is a callback for a function in a GUI for spike sorting.

- Does many things at once
    - Manipulates the GUI
    - Modifies data
    - Reads a jpg file?
- Uses magic numbers and magic columns
- Uses various string formatting functions and `exec`
- Big function
- Not complex, but it's complicated

# Tightly coupled

- When code is tightly coupled (does a lot of unrelated things at once) it becomes very hard to reason about.
- Let's say your results are weird, are they weird because...
    - the data is bad
    - you're loading the data wrong
    - your model is incorrectly implemented
    - your model is inappropriate for the data
    - you statistical tests are inappropriate for the data distribution
- Let's say you want to describe to someone what the bug is in your code

# Uncouple and simplify

- Keep each of the boxes separate with minimal interface
    - Separation of concerns:
        - example: your data loading function should just load data
        - Your computation functions shouldn't load data, they should just compute
- Make each of the boxes small
    - don't make giant monolithic functions
    - Make functions which are small
        - a screen's worth, 80 columns, 50 lines
- Avoid side effects, prefer pure functions

# What's a side effect?

> In computer science, an operation, function or expression is said to have a side effect if it modifies some state variable value(s) outside its local environment, that is to say has an observable effect besides returning a value (the main effect) to the invoker of the operation. State data updated "outside" of the operation may be maintained "inside" a stateful object or a wider stateful system within which the operation is performed. Example side effects include modifying a non-local variable, modifying a static local variable, modifying a mutable argument passed by reference, performing I/O or calling other side-effect functions. (Wikipedia)

# A function with side effects

Q: what will be printed?

```{.python}
def reversi(arr):
    """Reverses a list."""
    for i in range(len(arr) // 2):
        arr[-i - 1], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[-i - 1]
    return arr

>>> a = [0, 1, 2]
>>> b = reversi(a)
>>> print(b)
>>> print(a)
```

# A function which changes its arguments

![This function mutates its arguments](../figures/reversi.PNG)

# Side effects

* Modifying arguments
* Printing
* Making API calls
* Changing globals

# Side effects are not the best

* Stuff happens outside of the normal flow from arguments â†’ return value
* Need to know state of function to understand it
* Hard to test
* Let's box them
    * You can use closures or classes to encapsulate state

# Demo

* `fib.py`
* Fibonacci sequence, $F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$
* Memoization

# Learn more about your language

- Sometimes (but not always!), code smells come from lack of knowledge
    - E.g. using magic column numbers in a raw numpy array rather than named columns in pandas because you don't know pandas
    - Using unnamed dimensions in numpy rather than xarray
    - Using + and bespoke casting for string formatting rather than the one true solution, the f-string
- Take time to learn more about the language you use

# Enough theory!

Let's de-couple CKA!

# Background on centered kernel alignment

Q: how can we compare how different brain areas and artificial neural networks represent the world?

A: Choose a standard battery of stimuli, measure responses across systems, compare the responses between the systems. Many approaches, including: 

* forward encoding models (e.g. ridge regression)
* canonical correlation analysis (CCA)
* representational similarity analysis (RSA). 

# CKA

[Kornblith et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00414) propose a new method to compare representations. You can think of it as a generalization of the (square of the) Pearson correlation coefficient, but with matrices instead of vectors.

![Alignment between layers of two neural nets initialized with different seeds](../figures/cka_example.png){height=100px}

Importantly for us, this method is not implemented in scipy, or sklearn, or PyMVPA, and github gives very few hits...

...this is real research code!

# Centered kernel alignment

* Same number of stimuli $n$, potentially different numbers of features
* Let's collect the responses of each system into matrices $\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}$, each $n$ high. 
* Center $\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}$ so each column has 0 mean, then:

$$CKA(\mathbf X, \mathbf Y) = \frac{||\mathbf X^T \mathbf Y||_2^2}{||\mathbf X^T \mathbf X||_2 ||\mathbf Y^T \mathbf Y||_2}$$

* Min 0, max 1
* Check: if $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ are one-dimensional, then $CKA = \rho( \mathbf X, \mathbf Y)^2$.


# Live coding!



# Points from live coding example

* Often, analysis scripts have a clear flow from inputs to computation to outputs
* Put the controller in the `main` function, hide behind `__name__ == "__main__"`
    * Avoids module variables in Python
    * Makes the code importable
* Isolate the computation in its own function independent of IO

# Configuration

* Keep your configuration our of your code
    * Use `argparse` to specify options via the command line
    * Keep configuration options located in an importable `config.py` file
    * Use `python-dotenv` to store secrets in a `.env` file

# You can apply this advice at a project-wide level as well

Advice from [van Vliet (2020)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007358):

1. **Each analysis step is one script**
2. **A script either processes a single experimental replicate, or aggregates across replicates, never both.**
3. One master script to run the entire analysis
4. **Save all intermediate results**
5. Visualize all intermediate results
6. **Each parameter and filename is defined only once**
7. Distinguish files that are a part of the official pipeline


# Lesson 2

* Keep things decoupled
* By keeping things decoupled, you can think about one part of your program at a time
* Save your WM slots
* Your 5-minute exercise: take existing code and wrap it in `main`
