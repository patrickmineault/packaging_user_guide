# Lesson 5

Maybe the real good code is the friends we made along the way

# Lesson 5

Work with better people than you

# Reality check

* People think that programming is a solitary activity
* Reality: at a place like Google, programming is very social
    * readability
    * code reviews
    * design reviews
    * pair programming
    * reading groups
    * retreats
    * performance reviews

# Practical tips

* Open an issue in an open source project
* Open a PR in an open source project
* Set up pair programming with people in your lab
* Set up a review circle

# Lesson 5

* Work with better people than you
* It's a bit of a stretch to make this work with the theme of WM & LTM
    * The most important point: grow with people
* Your 5-minute exercise: schedule one pair-programming session
